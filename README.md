# Olympics-history-Analysis

- This repository contains the code and data for a project on 120 years of Olympic history exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project uses the athlete_events.csv dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle. Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=athlete_events.csv


## Data Source

- The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). The columns are:

- ID - Unique number for each athlete
- Name - Athlete's name
- Sex - M or F
- Age - Integer
- Height - In centimeters
- Weight - In kilograms
- Team - Team name
- NOC - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
- Games - Year and season
- Year - Integer
- Season - Summer or Winter
- City - Host city
- Sport - Sport
- Event - Event
- Medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA

## Installation
The following tools were used for this analysis:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Sklearn

- To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries by running the following command:


- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy plotly

    
## Usage 
- To run the analysis, simply execute the notebook. The script will generate several visualizations that help illustrate analysis of data.
## Roadmap

The analysis includes the following tasks:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis

The analysis includes visualizations using Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn.

## Result





In this analysis, we explored the "athlete_events.csv" dataset using EDA techniques to gain insights into the Olympic athlete events. The dataset provides a comprehensive record of athletes and their performances across various Olympic games.

We began by performing data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality. Missing values were handled appropriately, and any inconsistencies or errors in the data were addressed. Additionally, we checked for data integrity and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.

Next, we conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and interesting observations within the dataset. Key findings from our analysis include:

1. Distribution of Athletes: We examined the distribution of athletes across different countries, genders, and age groups. We discovered which countries had the highest number of participating athletes and identified any significant gender disparities in terms of participation.

2. Olympic Events and Sports: We explored the variety of sports and events represented in the dataset. We analyzed the frequency of each sport and event, identifying the most popular ones among the athletes. Furthermore, we investigated any changes in the diversity and number of events across different Olympic editions.

3. Medal Distribution: We analyzed the distribution of medals among the athletes. We examined the countries with the highest number of medals, both overall and in specific sports. Additionally, we investigated any patterns or trends in medal-winning performances over time.

4. Athlete Performance: We delved into the performance metrics of athletes, such as age, height, weight, and relevant physical attributes. We examined how these attributes varied across sports and events and explored their impact on athletes' success in winning medals.

Overall, this analysis of the "athlete_events.csv" dataset provided valuable insights into Olympic athlete events. The findings shed light on the trends, patterns, and dynamics within the dataset and helped us understand the factors influencing athletes' performances and medal-winning probabilities.

It is important to note that this analysis represents a snapshot of the dataset and serves as a starting point for further investigations. Future researchers can build upon this work to explore more specific research questions, develop predictive models, or uncover deeper insights from this rich Olympic dataset.
